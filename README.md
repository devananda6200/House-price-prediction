This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict house prices based on various features. By analyzing historical data on housing attributes/features, 
our goal is to provide accurate price predictions for real estate properties.

Key components include:

Data Exploration and Preprocessing: Understanding the dataset(HousePricePrediction.xlsx), cleaning data, and preparing it for modeling.

Model Training using the LinearRegression class from sklearn.linear_model to build a predictive model.

Evaluation: Assessing model performance with metrics such as Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) to ensure accuracy.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required packages:
